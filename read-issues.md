description: Read all wireframe issues files silently (no summary output)
---

Read and internalize all wireframe issues without summarizing.

## Instructions

1. **Read GENERAL_ISSUES.md** (recurring patterns):
   - `docs/design/wireframes/GENERAL_ISSUES.md`

2. **Find and read all per-SVG issues files**:
   - Pattern: `docs/design/wireframes/**/*.issues.md`

3. **Output only**:
   > "Read [N] issues files. Ready."

**DO NOT**:
- Summarize the issues
- List the patterns found
- Create tables or analysis
- Explain what you learned

The user already knows the issues. This command is for loading context into your memory before working on wireframes.
